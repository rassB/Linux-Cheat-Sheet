# Basic
## Find files and directories with `locate`
Find files that contain the string `file2` in their name:
```console
user@ubuntu:/$ locate file2
/home/user/Documents/file2.txt
/home/user/Documents/file2_sorted.txt
/home/user/Documents/file2_sorted_uniq.txt
```

The command `locate` queries a database containing all list of files and directories in the system. This database is updated
periodically, so when we try to locate new files, we might not find them.  
In this case, we can update the database manually using the command `updatedb` before searching:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo updatedb
```

## Find files and directories using `find`
Find the file `file2.txt` in the directory `Documents/`:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find Documents/ -name "file2.txt"
Documents/file2.txt
```

Ignore the case (uppercase/lowercase) when searching for a file:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find Documents/ -iname "file2.txt"
Documents/File2.TXT
Documents/File2.txt
Documents/file2.txt
```

**PS** : By default, `find` search for both files and directories.


# Advanced
## Advanced searching with `find`
Search for files with extension `.txt` in the current directory:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -iname "*.txt"        
./Documents/file2_sorted_uniq.txt
./Documents/File2.TXT
./Documents/file2_sorted.txt
./Documents/numbers.txt
./Documents/File2.txt
./Documents/file2.txt
./Documents/file.txt
```

Search for files that contains the string `pic` in their name:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -iname "*pic*" 
./Pictures
./Pictures/picture.png
./Pictures/picture2.png
```

Search for directories only:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -iname "*pic*" -type d
./Pictures
```

`-type d` can be replaced by `-type f` to search for files only, or `-type l` to search for links only.

Search for files/dirs modified during the previous 30 days:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -mtime -30
.
./.viminfo
./.bash_history
./.vim
./.vim/.netrwhist
./Documents
./Documents/file2_sorted_uniq.txt
./Documents/File2.TXT
./Documents/file2_sorted.txt
./Documents/numbers.txt
./Documents/File2.txt
./Documents/file2.txt
./Documents/file.txt
./Pictures
```

Search for files/dirs that were modified before 30 days ago:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -mtime +30
./.bashrc
./.profile
./Desktop
./.bash_logout
./Templates
./Music
./Videos
./.sudo_as_admin_successful
./Pictures/picture.png
./Pictures/picture2.png
./Downloads
./Public
```

To search using files/dirs using **access time** instead of **modification time**, use `-atime` instead of `-mtime`.

Search for files that are heavier than 50Mb:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -size +50M
./Videos/video.mkv
```

We can remplace `M` (Megabyte) by `k` (Kilobyte) or `G` (Gigabyte).


## Perform actions on found files with `find`
Delete all empty files in the current directory:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -size 0 -delete -print
./Documents/File2.TXT
./Documents/File2.txt
```

Print found files using `ls -dils` format:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find Documents/ -iname "file2.txt" -ls
 12190591      0 -rw-r--r--   1 user     user            0 Aug 26 17:04 Documents/File2.TXT
 12190598      0 -rw-r--r--   1 user     user            0 Aug 26 17:03 Documents/File2.txt
 12190588      4 -rw-r--r--   1 user     user           77 Aug 26 17:03 Documents/file2.txt
```

Execute a command on found files. In this example, we will move all `.jpg` files in the current directory to the directory
`Pictures`:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ find . -iname '*.jpg' -print -exec mv {} Pictures/ \;
./Videos/pic2.jpg
./Videos/pic.jpg
```
