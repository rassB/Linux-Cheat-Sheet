uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),27(sudo)

```

## List groups that a user belongs to
```console

```

## List members of a group
```console
user@ubuntu:/$ grep 'mygroup:' /etc/group

```

## Change file/directory owner
Change a file/directory owner and group:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo chown user2:user2 Documents/file.txt 
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Documents/file.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 user2 user2 5 Jun  4 23:25 Documents/file.txt
```

Change a a directory owner and group recursively:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ sudo chown -R user2:user2 Pictures/
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Pictures/
total 56
-rw-r--r-- 1 user2 user2 28991 Apr 13  2019 2019-04-13.png
-rw-r--r-- 1 user2 user2 24221 May 19  2019 2019-05-19.png
```

# Advanced
## Change file/directory permissions
Give the owner of the file read,write,execute permissions ; the group of the file read,write permissions ; the other users read permission only:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ chmod u=rwx,g=rw,o=r Documents/file.txt
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Documents/file.txt 
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user 5 Jun  4 23:25 Documents/file.txt
```

Add execute permissions for other users:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ chmod o+x Documents/file.txt 
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Documents/file.txt 
-rwxrw-r-x 1 user user 5 Jun  4 23:25 Documents/file.txt
```

Remove write permission from the group of the file:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ chmod g-w Documents/file.txt 
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Documents/file.txt 
-rwxr--r-x 1 user user 5 Jun  4 23:25 Documents/file.txt
```

Remove execute permissions from the owner of the file:
```console
user@ubuntu:~$ chmod u-x Documents/file.txt 
user@ubuntu:~$ ls -l Documents/file.txt 
-rw-r--r-x 1 user user 5 Jun  4 23:25 Documents/file.txt
```

All previous `chmod` examples can be used the same with directories.

A good tutorial about `chmod` usage to manipulate files/dirs permissions: [https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/](https://www.howtogeek.com/437958/how-to-use-the-chmod-command-on-linux/)
